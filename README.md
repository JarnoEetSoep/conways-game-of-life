# Request:
## I have spent hours upon hours to figure out how to package this (create an .exe), and I have decided that I can better focus on the development of the application. If you know how to package this, please contact me (Discord: JarnoTheProgrammer#5809).

# Conways-Game-of-Life
Conway's game of Life in Python 3 using tkinter.

# Installation
### Download
First of all, make sure you have at least python 3.X.X at your machine. Then click the nice green button saying "Clone or download", then click the button saying "Download ZIP" and save the ZIP somewhere. Now, you need to unzip the ZIP.

### Install
Navigate through your command prompt (cmd, terminal) to the folder you just got by unzipping the ZIP. Now run:
* Windows: `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Apple / Linux: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Start
Start Conway's Game of Life by running `app/__main__.py` or just `py app` (Linux: `python3 app`). If everything works correctly, a window should show up. Good luck playing with it!
